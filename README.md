# AmeisenBot - WoW 3.3.5a Bot
A bot written in (at this time) C# only for World of Warcraft WotLK (3.3.5a 12340) (the best WoW :P)

*!!! Currently this thing is only a playground for me to try out memory-hacking related stuff, but maybe it turns into something useable in the near future... !!!*

**Libaries used:** MemorySharp by Binarysharp - https://github.com/ZenLulz/MemorySharp

## Modules
**AmeisenBotGUI**: This is the bot's GUI (C# WPF), what did you expect? :D

**AmeisenCore**: This is where the memory magic happens, data gets stored, etc.

**AmeisenOffsets**: Memory offsets can be foud here.

**AmeisenServer**: This thing is planned to be a server for the bots to communicate to each other.

**AmeisenAI**: The bots "Brain" to work on its Queue and make decisions etc.
