# AmeisenBot - WoW 3.3.5a Bot [![Build Status](https://jenkins.jnns.de/buildStatus/icon?job=AmeisenBot)](https://jenkins.jnns.de/job/AmeisenBot/)

A bot written in (at this time) C# only for World of Warcraft WotLK (3.3.5a 12340) (the best WoW :P).
This project will be developed like "Kraut und R√ºben" (Herb and beet?) as we say here in Germany, its a synonym for messy, so deal with it üòé.

‚ö†Ô∏è Currently this thing is only a playground for me to try out memory-hacking related stuff, but maybe it turns into something useable in the near future...

## Usage

Although i don't recommend to run this thing in this stage, **you can do it!**

üïπÔ∏è **How to use the Bot:**
Compile it, Start it, profit i guess?

üñ•Ô∏è **How to use the Server:**
Start the "AmeisenServer.exe", it will open a sketchy HTTP-Api at port 16200...

üåµ **How to enable AutoLogin:**
Place the "WoW-LoginAutomator.exe" in the same folder as the bot, thats all...

üí© **Web Interface**
To use this piece of turd, junk, trash, don't know how to call this thing, Open the "index.html" thats hidden deep in the shittiest corner of this project...
üí° *Pro Tip: look for a file called: "groessterMuellEUWest.javashit"*
