# AmeisenBot - WoW 3.3.5a Bot

A bot written in (at this time) C# only for World of Warcraft WotLK (3.3.5a 12340) (the best WoW :P)

*!!! Currently this thing is only a playground for me to try out memory-hacking related stuff, but maybe it turns into something useable in the near future... !!!*

‚öôÔ∏è**Libaries used:** Blackmagic - https://github.com/acidburn974/Blackmagic

üåµ **How to enable AutoLogin:**
Place the "WoW-LoginAutomator.exe" in the same folder as the bot, thats all
